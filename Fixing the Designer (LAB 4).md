# How to fix the Designer

Unforunately, due to a bug that currently exists on Service Portal, incorporating Angular Providers into widgets can break the Designer and render it unusable. Luckily, <strong>there's a fix.</strong>

We will be talking about the full fix on stage. However, by simply...

1. <strong>Removing</strong> the Provider from the related list on the widget
2. Performing the actions necessary in the Designer
3. <strong>Adding</strong> the Provider back to the widget

... you will be good to go! :)
